                    Many new BSD players have never participated in a draft
                    league before. The beauty of this league is that you sign
                    up on your own &mdash; there&apos;s no need to find a team
                    that&apos;s trying to organize. Also? You get to play with
                    players that have roughly the same skill levels and
                    you&apos;re guaranteed to play!

                            Each season we hold several weeks of tryouts. The
                            first week is limited mostly to new-to-BSD players
                            and lets the captains see each player go through
                            skills drills as well as play quick matches with a
                            team. Players are initially grouped by a rough
                            estimation of their skills (based on their
                            experience notes &amp; other info). Based on
                            feedback from the observing captains, we will shift
                            players here and there to ensure they are being
                            seen at the right levels. The goal is to have the
                            new players seen by as many captains as possible to
                            gain info on their skills &amp; speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second and third weeks of tryouts are open to
                            all players (captains included!) and are focused on
                            gameplay. These matches lets captains see how well
                            players move and communicate and execute skills in
                            the game setting. For the second week, players are
                            placed on preseason teams based on the division
                            they last played (for returning players) or where
                            they look most suited (based on new
                            players&apos; first tryouts). Captains then give us
                            their feedback on players and we reseed the teams
                            for the third week of tryouts to balance skills
                            &amp; speed even further.

                        How do BSD&apos;s drafts work?

                            With typically 5-6 divisions each season and with
                            most divisions having 6 teams, the drafts can be a
                            bit hectic. Prior to the tryouts starting, each
                            division&apos;s commissioner works to line up
                            volunteer captains who are likely qualified for
                            that division and can attend tryouts and can
                            participate in the draft. During the preseason
                            play, the commissioner will be communicating with
                            those captains, gathering feedback on players, etc.

                        <p>
                            After the third week of tryouts finish, the drafts
                            start! Drafts start with the highest division and
                            work their way to BB (our lowest division). The
                            Commissioner will solicit &ldquo;homework&rdquo;
                            from their captains &mdash; that homework consists
                            of each captain privately grouping the players into
                            rounds. Those homeworks are compiled with the
                            Commissioner&apos;s own groupings to arrive at a
                            consensus for the draft round that paired players
                            and captains should be selected. The Commissioner
                            and captains then meet up and conduct the actual
                            draft. When that&apos;s complete, we remove the
                            drafted players from the list of available players
                            and notify the next division&apos;s Commissioner
                            who repeats the process.

                            The result? Each season, the teams within a
                            division are typically very competitive because the
                            players are well balanced on skills and speed. And
                            for you as a player, that means you get to play on
                            a team that matches your own skill level pretty
                            well! And as a bonus, you get to meet possibly new
                            teammates and make new friends! Many of our players
                            have told us that they have made lasting
                            friendships from teammates or opponents they have
                            met in the league.

                            From the beginning, this league has emphasized
                            inclusion and teamwork. Teams are comprised of 8
                            players (almost always) and comprised of as even a
                            mix of genders as our registrations allow each
                            season. As well, when winning a sideout, teams are
                            expected to rotate all players &mdash; so players
                            off the court will rotate on, and players on the
                            court will rotate off. There is no subbing. This
                            ensures everyone on a team gets a fair share of
                            playing and contributing to their team&apos;s
                            success!

                            BSD runs a 3-week, double-elimination playoff
                            format. At a minimum your team will get to play two
                            matches in the playoffs and it could be as many as
                            6 depending on your wins &amp; losses. We do take
                            playoffs seriously. Each match will have a work
                            team assigned who provide line judges &amp; a
                            scorekeeper &amp; a down ref. There are more
                            restrictions on subs during playoffs as well, in an
                            effort to make sure teams stay at the same level of
                            competitiveness.
